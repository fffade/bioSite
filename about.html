      <h1>About Emme</h1>

      <p>
        &emsp;Emme Peters is a 22-year-old aspiring artist, born in Horseheads, a small village in New York. Growing up, Emme had a rough childhood, with a neglectful mother who never wanted her in the house. She spent most of her days with other family members, her friends, or even just roaming the streets of her village. She lived with her four younger sisters, Laura, Kota, Kitty, and Eliza. When Emme was home, she’d be forced to take care of her sisters as if she were their guardian. Her academic life was just as difficult as her home life. Child protective services would often pull her out of class to question her, and she’d miss a lot of class too, because her mother was unwilling to wake her up on time or even take her there. By the 8th grade, Emme dropped out so her mother could attempt to homeschool her, which was unsuccessful. Eventually, she entered a GED program herself and graduated when she was 17.

        &emsp;Nowadays, Emme lives with her aunt in Elmira in a household of 7 people total. Living with her is Kitty, her 17-year-old sister, whom she now has custody of. Emme works part-time at a nearby hospital, sanitizing rooms, although her real interests still lie in creative work such as writing, storytelling, and drawing. In her free time, she plays a lot of video games – mostly idle-type games for a quick buzz of excitement, because she has ADHD, but her most-played video game is likely League of Legends (a multiplayer online battle arena game). At one point, she attempted a degree in fine arts and design but realized that the classes did not suit her taste. She also does not see a degree as a must-have for her desired path in life. Emme considers her sisters as her true passion in life – she wants to keep them happy and safe. She states, “I just want to leave behind our awful childhoods”. Additionally, when asked what she wants to achieve, she claimed that she wants to publish a complete story (with both the writing and illustration done by her) and put it out there for at least one person in the world to enjoy.
